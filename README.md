this is a readme, cant u read the name???


ToDo:
- make sure no double instance of the bot is running
- document all the complicated shit before I forget (too late now)
- also get rid of unnesecarry JDA initialisations
- write an actually helpful readme (optional)
- setup gateway intent stuff
- replace all List<Object> botTasks with just BotTask as a class
- improve reflective injections, maybe add option to return a string and auto-respond with that
- from JDAInstanceManager: Todo: get rid of this crap, put the functionality into DiscordBot or remove it entirely
